# IoT_Simulation_Corona
Setting up a Corona Tracking simulation in Cooja Simulation tools by initializing Sky-micro controller motes. A scenario is created where motes spread virus, some get infected and go to quarantine after coming in contact.

- Using Contiki-NG OS for IoT devices programmed in C
- Sending NullNet layer packets from the serial port through the sockets in python to store and maintain excel and aws-based database of the beacons.
